Here's the Python code that converts the given Matlab code to clean, efficient, and idiomatic Python code:
```python
def calculate_sum(n):
    s = 0; for i in range(1,n+1)):
        s += i; return s
    return s
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input. It initializes a variable `s` to zero, and then iterates over the range of 1 to `n+1`). For each iteration, it adds the current value to `s`. Finally, it returns the final value of `s`.
You can call this function with any integer `n` as input. The function will return the final value of `s`, which is the sum of all the values in the range 1 to `n+1`).
